âœ… Why this fixes your issue

Browsers share cookies per tab and normal window. So if you:

Sign in as User A, then User B in the same browser window

You overwrite session data and cause cross-user leakage

Using completely separate private windows guarantees Flask assigns and maintains independent session['user_id'] values for each.
